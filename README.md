# leaflet-nyc-biking-map
A Leaflet map coded in html which shows bike lanes, cyclist fatalities and median income by census tract in New York City.

This map was made to complement a memo on bike lane policy in New York City completed as a final body of work for my B.A. in Public Policy from NYU. To see some tweets about other research which came from the project, view them [here](https://twitter.com/victor_porcelli/status/1403410199185006592) and [here](https://twitter.com/victor_porcelli/status/1403409695797256195).

Additionally, the final memo can be found in this repository.
